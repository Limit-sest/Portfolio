# [Limit's portfolio](https://limit6.eu)
Welcome to my portfolio website! This is where I showcase my projects. My goals for this site were to make it SEO-friendly, optimized, and easy to maintain.
## Techstack:
![Techstack for the portfolio](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=svelte,html,js,tailwind)

## Want to try yourself?
If you’d like to explore the code on your own machine or use this as a starting point for your own portfolio, here’s how to get started:

```bash
# First, obtain the repository and enter it.
$ git clone https://github.com/Limit-sest/Portfolio.git && cd Porfolio
```
